// Solidity is a 'typed' language , as opposed to JavaScript which is an untyped language

// To declare variables in Solidity, the 'type' needs to be declared

int a = 1; // signed integer -> can be negative
uint aa = 2; // unsigned integer -> can't be negative ; only (n >= 0)
string b = "hello";
bool c = false;
address d = 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4;
